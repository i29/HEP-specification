## Building your Dapp

### DApp Type 

Now HEP supports three kinds of Dapps to integration:

| Dapp type                      | Description                                                                                                                                  | Language                      |
| ---                            | ---                                                                                                                                          | ---                           |
| **[DMA - Decentralized Mobile App](DMA.md)**           | Runs natively in iOS or Android. Downloadable from Apple App Store or Google Play Store                                                      | Swift (iOS) or Java (Android) |
| **[DWEB - Decentralized Web](DWEB.md)**                 | A regular website with hooks into the HEP API                                                                                             | Javascript                    |
| **[NewDApp](NewDApp.md)** | A decentralized app that runs on [NewVM](NewVM.md). Similar to [WeChat mini-programs](https://walkthechat.com/wechat-mini-programs-simple-introduction/) | Javascript or [NewLang](NewLang.md)                    |
